# JayMeter-Mozaic-Script
Jay Meter is a midi timing sequencer preset for Mozaic (ruismaker.com/mozaic/) which can perform forward and backward offsets. Designed for Hip Hop, IDM, and any genre where human or off-kilter grooves are required.
In order to accomplish forward offsets, a global offset is provided to delay all midi input by a specified amount. Thus "negative" timing delays are therefore possible.
